# As if!

This repository explores the use of git branches by providing an
alternative history in each branch. The format is simple:

* One file per century, with CE and BCE prefixes (e.g. CE-1200 for the
  13th century CE).
* One line per year in the century. You don't have to fill out every
  year ;)
  
The master branch is the normal, boring, "official" history. But you
can find much more interesting histories in other branches. For
example, `jurassic-park`.
